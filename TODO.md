# TODO

## P0
- Proper README
- Full clean of the project
- Deploy with Terraform
- Either require npm or build npm inside the container (or better yet, spin up a container to compile it then get rid of it)
- Remove Docker dependency?

## P2
- [Static](https://codepen.io/run-time/pen/knqDo) over map?
- Geocoder?
- Sedding on my birthday on the resume output is dumb and resume-cli (should take non dates (like "current", or "present").)
- Add a repos section
