At MemSQL engineering there are few things we love as much as building great products. One, however, is a good laugh. This past weekend a team from MemSQL set out to make our mothers proud at [Cultivated Wit](https://www.cultivatedwit.com/)’s [Comedy Hack Day](http://www.comedyhackday.org/), an event for comedians and hackers to get together in attempt to make the funniest hack. And drink whiskey.

I’m very excited to share with you our product today, the grand prize winner, and the future of wearable technology. Engineering at MemSQL goes to great lengths to ensure that our technology enhances your life, rather than detracting from your special moments. Our engineering and design teams have determined that the best place for strapping technology to your body is not to your face or to your wrist, but rather, to your shoulder.

The wait is over, the next furry thing is here. We present to you: AwwCog – the future of wearable technology.

It comes in _the perfect size for everyone_. Isn’t it beautiful? Wait a second, then look again. It’s still beautiful, isn’t it? It’s even programmable in python! Since the original Furby was invented, nothing has been this revolutionary. We’re awesome. We know.

If you’re an engineer that likes to laugh as much as you like to code, we want to talk to you. Reach out to us at recruiting@memsql.com, and let us know who you are, and what you like to build.

For the technical folk that want to build their own AwwCogs, or contribute to the code, the repos can be found at:
