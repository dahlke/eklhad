Hey there, I’m Neil, a software engineer raised in Chicago, living in San Francisco.

I’ve been writing code since I was 17. I built and sold websites to family and friends at 18, and started working in the industry at 19. My journey has been unique - I’ve worked on frontends, backends, data pipelines, databases, security projects, networking projects, infrastructure projects, scheduling projects - you name it.

My journey has crystallized my DNA as a truly all-stack engineer, with a twist: I enjoy helping external organizations with their issues that my unique history has given me expertise in. It keeps me fresh. I’ve worked in the public sector and the private sector. In research, banking, and tech. I’ve approached each industry’s unique challenges with a solution focused mindset. As we say at HashiCorp - “Workflows, not technologies”.

Feel free to approach me - I’m always up for a chat. If you don’t know where to start, ask me about data, cloud infrastructure, skiing, music, or the NBA. I suspect we'll find common ground.
